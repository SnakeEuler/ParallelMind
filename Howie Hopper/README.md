## Introduction
___
This is our game. 

## Parallel Relay and Event System
A light weight and customizable event management system that is a work in progress. I features basic pooling and
garbage collection. 

This includes a super easy to use, inspector friendly scriptable event system that uses all kinds of generics. 

## Parallel State Machine
A hierarchical state machine to handle complex behaviors effeciently if needed. It is event driven and works with 
the Parallel Relay system. It uses a builder pattern for designing and implementing states and transitions to help 
make things as easy as possible when in the weeds and wanting to get to the good stuff. 

## Miscellaneous
There are a few utilities and extensions that I have collected from here and there. 

## Input Channel
This is my method for creating a safe and decoupled structure for handing raw input data from the Input Systems 
Input Assets. It's a scriptable object for ease of access and also uses events as above.
